## Usage
Open index.html
## attributions
  When creating the index.html, I referred to the actual Path@Penn website by checking the Chrome DevTools.
  
  After writing index.html, I used Claude to generate starter code for my css file. It is also included as basic.css.
  
  I created style.css based on it.
